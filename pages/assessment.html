                Psychological assessment is a collaborative process designed to help an
                individual (of any age) and the important people in their life to recognize things
                about themselves and their world that are not always easy to see or
                understand. The assessment process is helpful for understanding the
                emotional and intellectual life of an individual and acts as a valuable input to
                any mental health professional for reaching a more informed diagnosis. This
                process not only leads to recommendations for treatment, but also provides
                the individual and/or the family members with greater insights into the
                problems of living they have been facing. <br><br>
                <b>How do I know if I or my family member needs or can benefit from a
                    psychological assessment?</b><br><br>
                    A psychological assessment is useful in the following scenarios: <br><br>
                    1. You or your family member is undergoing some intellectual, behavioural
                    or emotional difficulties and you or a professional you are seeing would
                    like to have a diagnostic clarification for the same. <br> 
                    2. You have some questions about yourself, your work, your behaviour or
                    your feelings and you would like to have a better understanding of these
                    issues. Examples of some questions typically asked by people of different
                    age groups are listed below. <br><br>
                <b>What are the steps involved in the assessment process?</b><br><br>
                Step 1: In the first session, the assessor will meet with the individual and/or
                the family members to develop an understanding of the presenting issues or
                questions prompting the assessment. This will also help decide which
                assessment procedures to use. Once the choice of assessment procedures has
                been made, the assessor will provide an estimate of time and cost to the
                patient and/or the family. If the time needed and cost is acceptable,
                assessment sessions will be scheduled. <br><br>
                Step 2: The individual will undergo the process of assessment with the
                assessor. Gupta. This might take 3-10 sessions. Each session is typically 1.5- 2
                hours long. In the case of children, the psychologist might schedule a play
                interview or might even want to talk to school teachers to get a more detailed
                impression of the child. Some of the assessment procedures are paper and
                pencil type, while others are done while interacting with the psychologist.
                    <br><br>
                Step 3: After about a week of the last assessment session with the client, the
                assessor will meet the client and/or the family members to discuss the test
                results. In case the assessment has been requested by another professional,
                the assessor will also call him/her to discuss the results.
                    <br><br>
                Step 4: The assessor will take somewhere between 5-7 days after the feedback
                session to email the report.
