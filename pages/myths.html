            <p>
                It is human to be emotional and go through emotional suffering. Whatever the source of
                this suffering may be, we all undergo moments in our lives when we need another human
                being who we can rely on for emotional support, to help us make sense of what we are
                going through and to help us come out of it stronger. Psychotherapy is a process that deals
                with such issues professionally. Unfortunately, few people in India make use of this service
                even when they need it. While part of the under use can be explained by the fact that there
                is limited awareness as well as limited availability of this service, the bigger factors are the
                widely prevalent myths about psychotherapy that exist in our society. <br><br>

                <span class="underline">Myth #1: Attending Psychotherapy is a sign of weakness:</span> Often, despite feeling
                considerable emotional stress, people hesitate in taking professional help because they feel
                it is a sign of weakness. On the other hand, people feel that if they can deal with their
                problems on their own, they will be seen as “strong”. Unfortunately, the effort to remain
                “strong” does more harm in the long run. It is easier to suppress one’s feelings rather than
                explore and work through them. Therefore, sharing one’s feelings openly with a trained
                mental health professional is a sign of courage rather than of weakness. <br><br>

                <span class="underline">Myth #2: Psychotherapy is only for people who have mental health problems:</span> Psychotherapy
                is not meant only for people who have severe mental health problems. It has been found to
                be useful for people who find themselves in emotional distress, confusion, or some other
                emotionally challenging situation. This does not mean that they are “mentally ill”; it only
                means that their mental health is being affected. For many people, who are otherwise
                functioning normally in their lives, psychotherapy has been helpful in developing self-
                understanding. For some people, the goal of psychotherapy could be to work towards living
                a more healthy and positive lifestyle. In fact, in many training programs, prospective mental
                health professionals are required to attend psychotherapy themselves so that they develop
                a better self understanding before they can help others. <br><br>

                <span class="underline"> Myth #3: If I attend psychotherapy, I will be seen as “abnormal” or “mad” by my friends and
                    family:</span> As we have discussed, psychotherapy is not only for people who have mental health
                problems. Unfortunately, seeing a mental health professional is still seen negatively in the
                Indian society, though there is increasing awareness about the need for this process with
                each passing day.<br><br>
                As far as being considered “mad” is concerned, it is often the healthiest member of the
                family and usually the healthiest member of a couple who seeks help first. The person who
                seeks help is most frequently someone who is sensitive enough to have picked up that
                something in their life or family or relationships is amiss. Seeking help is often a sign of
                mental health and mental strength. <br><br>
                Further, a counseling or therapeutic relationship ensures confidentiality of the person in all
                conditions except if the client’s safety or those of others is in question. In other words, what
                you share with your therapist will remain only between you and your therapist. Other
                people don’t have to know that you are seeing a mental health professional if you want that
                information to be kept confidential. When interviewing a mental health professional, make
                sure they understand and agree to your confidentiality needs. <br><br>
                
                <span class="underline">Myth #4: If I start seeing a counselor or psychotherapist, I will become dependent on them
                    forever:</span> The goal of every therapy relationship is to help the client become independent. A
                    psychotherapist’s job is to help one understand why they feel the way they do and what lies
                    behind their responses to other people and to things that happen to them. Many people
                    find that this understanding helps them to deal more successfully with problems and
                    distress. They come out of the therapeutic process more independent and more self-aware.<br><br>

                <span class="underline">Myth #5: Psychotherapy is an indulgent activity undertaken by the rich:</span> Psychotherapy is
                    sought by and can help people from different socio-economic backgrounds. To develop self-
                    understanding is a healthy thing to do. And of course, if one is in emotional distress, or has
                    severe mental health problems, then psychotherapy becomes a necessity.<br><br>

                <span class="underline">Myth #6: I don’t need a psychotherapist to share my feelings. I can just talk to a friend or a
                    family member who I am close to:</span> Many of us find emotional relief in talking to people we
                    feel close to. Sometimes the relief comes merely from venting out our feelings and some
                    times, the people we share our feelings with might also help us get a different perspective
                    on things. However, there are situations when we need an objective listener, someone who
                    is outside our family and circle of friends and therefore has no preconceived ideas about us.
                    Someone who is professionally trained to listen, and is neutral in the sense that s/he does
                    not have any personal needs attached to our lives, is in a unique position to give us fresh
                    insights into how we feel and respond to things. It is also important to keep in mind that a
                    trained professional might seem to be “merely” listening to us, when in fact, they are
                    trained to listen “actively” such that in the process of listening, they help us move towards
                    developing a deeper understanding of ourselves.<br><br>

                <span class="underline">Myth#7: Psychotherapy would not work for me. How can someone help me just be talking to
                    me? </span>The basis of psychotherapy is that we often have internal processes (feelings, conflicts,
                    thoughts) based on our life experiences, which become too complex for us to make sense of
                    ourselves or which remain outside our conscious awareness. These thoughts, feelings or
                    conflicts show up as symptoms (emotional distress, sadness, confusion, depression, anxiety,
                    physiological difficulties without any medical basis, addiction, low self esteem, anger issues,
                    etc) and affect our functioning and/or well being. When we begin to understand these
                    internal processes with the help of a professional who is trained to help us through this
                    process, the symptoms begin to show improvement. Sometimes, we don’t have any
                    observable symptoms as such, but just feel an inner discomfort, urge or simply a longing to
                    understand ourselves and our lives better. Psychotherapy can help us in this process.<br><br>

                <span class="underline">Myth#8: Psychotherapy is a business:</span> Would you say medicine is a business? How about
                    chartered accountancy? And architecture? Psychotherapy is no different in this respect.
                    Therapists are professionals who have lives of their own and financial responsibilities like
                    anyone else. Hence, it is only fair that they charge you for the professional service they
                    provide. In fact, one needs to beware of a counselor or therapist who claims to be ‘helping
                    out of the goodness of their hearts’. After all, what needs of their own are they getting
                    fulfilled in the process if it is not a means of livelihood for them. This is not to discount
                    altruistic efforts of people in any way, but it is just a reminder that one needs to be cautious
                    and mindful of these issues as the receiver of mental health services. It is also a well known
                    phenomenon that we often tend to take things for granted when they are given to us for
                    “free”.<br><br>

                <span class="underline">Myth #9: Psychotherapist will judge me and find faults with me:</span> All psychotherapists are
                trained to adopt a non-judgmental attitude towards their clients. The reason is that being
                judgmental towards someone does not really help them deal with their problems. It only
                makes them feel bad and defensive. Further, it is not fair to judge others based on what we
                feel is right! Remember, a psychotherapist’s job is to help their clients develop an
                understanding of themselves and use it to address their difficulties. They are not there to
                find faults with their clients, but are there to help them understand why they do what they
                do.<br><br>

                <span class="underline">Myth #10: I will have to talk about issues that I don't want to:</span> Nobody can force you to talk about or do anything you don't want to. Psychotherapists typically take your lead in the
                session and keep themselves focused on what you want to bring up in that particular
                session. With the trust that develops over time, you might yourself feel like bringing up
                issues you were reluctant to share in the beginning. The choice and freedom will be yours.
                The psychotherapy session and experience just seeks to provide a safe environment for you
                to share whatever you want to.<br><br>

                <span class="underline">Myth #11: Psychotherapy is boring. It is all about serious stuff:</span> Not necessarily. It can be a lot of fun too. Psychotherapy can become a very interesting process of self discovery. You don’t
                have to bring up serious material all the time. There are no restrictions of any sort. If you
                want to share lighter moments, you can do so. Many therapists adopt expressive art and
                play therapy approaches or are flexible to use these if need be. Some people find these
                alternate means of expression fun and less inhibiting.<br><br>

                <span class="underline">Myth #12: Psychotherapy is the only answer for people with mental health problems:</span> Like
                any other treatment modality, psychotherapy may not have all the answers for a person’s
                difficulties. Sometimes, medication might be needed more urgently. Sometimes, the person
                might need a combination of medication, psychotherapy and may be some other services
                such as support groups, occupational therapy, etc. The puzzle is how to get diagnosed
                properly so that the best treatment can be prescribed. A good psychotherapist will
                acknowledge his or her limitations and scope of competence and help you explore
                alternative treatment modalities..<br><br>
